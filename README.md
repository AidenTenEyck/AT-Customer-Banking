# AT-Customer-Banking
This repository contains the neccesary files to create a bank account for both saving and CD using the simple interest formula.
The main file of this repository 'Customer_banking.py' imports the 'create_savings_account function' from 'savings_account.py' and the 'create_cd_account' function from cd_account.py.
Both the 'savings_account.py' and the 'cd_account.py' files import the 'Account' class from the 'Accounts.py' file.
The create_account functions calculate interest and the new balance of the accounts using the imported 'Account' class to properly distribute variables and enable recalling of the interest earned or the current balance of the account.
The 'Main' function located inside the 'customer_banking.py' file is combines the create account functions with added user input.
